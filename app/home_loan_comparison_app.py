    - You maintain an OD account linked to your home loan
    - Any money in OD account reduces the effective outstanding balance
    - Interest is charged only on: Loan Balance - OD Balance
    - You can withdraw from OD account if needed (maintains liquidity)

    **Tax Implications:**
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è OD deposits are NOT considered principal repayment (No 80C benefit)
    - ‚úÖ Interest paid is still eligible for Section 24(b) deduction

    - **Legal Case:** Bank files civil + criminal case for recovery
    - **Permanent CIBIL Damage:** "Settled" or "Written-off" tag for 7 years

    **Real Example:**
    - Property Market Value: ‚Çπ80L
    - Outstanding Loan: ‚Çπ50L
    - Auction Sale: ‚Çπ55L (30% below market!)

    **Bank's Preferred Solutions (in order):**
    1. EMI moratorium for 3-6 months
    2. Tenure extension (reduces EMI)
    3. One-time settlement (pay less than full amount)

    st.markdown("""
    **What People Do:**
    - Take OD loan
    - Use OD balance as "extra spending money"
    - "I'll deposit it back next month" (never happens)

    **Result:**
    - Initial OD balance: ‚Çπ15L
    - After 2 years: ‚Çπ5L
    - Paying higher OD interest rate + no benefit!
    - Would've been better with regular loan!

    **Red Flags You're Not Disciplined for OD:**
    - You have credit card debt
    - You've taken personal loans in past 3 years
    - Your savings account balance is usually < ‚Çπ50K
    - You can't account for where last 3 months' salary went

    **If any red flag: Choose regular loan! OD will hurt you.**

    st.markdown("""
    **What People Do:**
    - Banks send annual statement in April/May
    - People ignore it
    - "I'm paying EMI on time, what else to check?"

    **What You're Missing:**
    - **Interest calculation errors** (banks do make mistakes!)
    - **Hidden charges** being debited
    - **Insurance premium auto-debits** (often higher than market)
    - **Processing fee revisions** (some banks silently increase!)
    - **Outstanding balance** not reducing as expected

    **What to Do:**
    - Download statement every April
    - Cross-check principal outstanding with your calculations
    - Verify interest charged matches loan rate
    - Check for any unknown charges
    - If mismatch: Call bank immediately, escalate to manager

    **Real Case:**
    - Customer found ‚Çπ50,000 error in 5-year-old loan
    - Bank had been charging 9.1% instead of agreed 8.8%
    - Got full refund + compensation!
    - All because he checked annual statement

### The Final Litmus Test

Calculate your **Break-even Surplus:**

**Formula:**
```
Break-even = (Regular Loan Interest - OD Interest) / (OD Rate - Regular Rate)
```

**Example:**
- Regular loan @ 8.6%: Interest = ‚Çπ54L
- OD loan @ 8.85%: If you park enough to save interest
- Rate difference: 0.25%

**If you can park > Break-even amount consistently ‚Üí OD wins**
**If you can't ‚Üí Regular loan is safer**

Use the calculator above to see YOUR break-even point!

<strong>Important Disclaimers:</strong>
<br><br>
1. <strong>OD Deposits ‚â† Principal Repayment:</strong> Money parked in overdraft account is NOT eligible for Section 80C deduction.
Only the actual principal component of EMI paid qualifies.

2. <strong>Interest Rates:</strong> These are indicative rates as of October 2025. Actual rates depend on your credit score,
loan amount, and relationship with the bank.
<br><br>
3. <strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Tax calculations assume old tax regime for self-occupied property. New tax regime has different rules.
Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation.
<br><br>
4. <strong>Minimum Loan Amounts:</strong> Overdraft facilities typically require minimum loan of ‚Çπ15-25 lakhs. Check with bank.
<br><br>
5. <strong>Discipline Required:</strong> Overdraft works best when you can consistently park surplus and resist unnecessary withdrawals.
