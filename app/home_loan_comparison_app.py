<div class="info-box">
<strong>üí° Key Insight:</strong> The overdraft option charges slightly higher interest ({od_loan['interest_rate']}% vs {regular_loan['interest_rate']}%),
but you're paying interest only on the <strong>effective outstanding amount</strong> (Loan - OD Balance).

With your initial surplus of ‚Çπ{surplus_amount:,.0f} and monthly additions of ‚Çπ{monthly_surplus:,.0f},

    st.markdown("### Day 31-60: Mortgage Release & Final Closure")
    st.markdown("""
    **What to Do:**
    - Visit sub-registrar office with NOC
    - Release mortgage from property
    - Update property records
    - Get updated property documents

    **Timeline:** 15-30 days

    **Process:**
    1. Take NOC + Closure Certificate to sub-registrar
    2. Pay mortgage release fee (‚Çπ500-‚Çπ2,000)
    3. Submit documents
    4. Appointment scheduled (1-2 weeks wait!)
    5. Visit on appointment day
    6. Mortgage removed from records
    7. Updated documents issued

    **Common Issues:**
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Appointment Delays:** Sub-registrar slots full for 3-4 weeks
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Document Mismatch:** Bank's NOC details don't match property records
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bank Representative Required:** Some offices need bank person present
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Online Not Available:** Must visit physically, take leave from work

    **After Completion:**
    - ‚úÖ Property is 100% yours (no mortgage)
    - ‚úÖ Can sell without bank involvement
    - ‚úÖ Can take loan on this property again
    - ‚úÖ Can gift/transfer freely

    **Pro Tip:** Do mortgage release immediately. Many people delay and face issues when selling later!

    st.markdown("### CIBIL Update Verification")
    st.markdown("""
    **Critical Final Step:** Verify loan shows as "CLOSED" in CIBIL

    **Timeline:** 30-45 days after closure

    **How to Check:**
    1. Visit www.cibil.com after 45 days of closure
    2. Pull your credit report (‚Çπ550)
    3. Check loan status: Should show "CLOSED" or "PAID"

    **Common Issues:**
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Still Shows Active:** Bank didn't update CIBIL
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Shows as Settled:** Banks sometimes mark as "Settled" (negative!) instead of "Closed"
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Outstanding Shows Non-Zero:** Shows ‚Çπ500 or ‚Çπ1,000 outstanding

    **What to Do If Not Updated:**
    1. Raise dispute on CIBIL website
    2. Attach loan closure certificate
    3. Email bank's nodal officer
    4. If not resolved in 30 days: Complaint to RBI ombudsman

    **Why It Matters:**
    - If shows "Active", you can't get another home loan
    - If shows "Settled", future loans will be rejected or expensive
    - Correct "Closed" status improves your credit score by 20-30 points!

<strong>üí° Reality Check:</strong>

<strong>Overdraft Loan:</strong> Total time: 30-45 days (additional scrutiny + OD account setup)

<strong>Loan Closure:</strong> Total time: 30-60 days (banks are slow with closure documentation)

<strong>Important Disclaimers:</strong>
<br><br>
1. <strong>OD Deposits ‚â† Principal Repayment:</strong> Money parked in overdraft account is NOT eligible for Section 80C deduction.
Only the actual principal component of EMI paid qualifies.
<br><br>
2. <strong>Interest Rates:</strong> These are indicative rates as of October 2025. Actual rates depend on your credit score,
loan amount, and relationship with the bank.
<br><br>
3. <strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Tax calculations assume old tax regime for self-occupied property. New tax regime has different rules.
Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation.
<br><br>
4. <strong>Minimum Loan Amounts:</strong> Overdraft facilities typically require minimum loan of ‚Çπ15-25 lakhs. Check with bank.
<br><br>
5. <strong>Discipline Required:</strong> Overdraft works best when you can consistently park surplus and resist unnecessary withdrawals.
<br><br>
<strong>Data Sources:</strong> Bank websites (HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, BoB, PNB), RBI guidelines,
Income Tax Act sections 80C & 24(b) (October 2025)
<br><br>
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> This is a comparison tool for educational purposes. Consult with your bank and a qualified
financial/tax advisor before making a decision. Home loan is a long-term commitment - choose wisely!
