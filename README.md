## üí° Key Insights

### When to Choose Regular Home Loan

‚úÖ **Best for you if:**
- You need the full loan amount immediately
- You have little to no surplus funds to park
- You prefer fixed, predictable EMIs
- You value simplicity over flexibility
- You're in the old tax regime and want 80C benefit
- Your income is stable and just covers EMI + expenses

### When to Choose Home Loan Overdraft

‚úÖ **Best for you if:**
- You can park ‚Çπ5L+ surplus initially
- You have monthly surplus of ‚Çπ20K+ over expenses
- You receive annual bonuses (‚Çπ2L+)
- You're a business owner with variable income
- You want liquidity (can withdraw if needed)
- Interest savings outweigh lost 80C benefit

### The Math Behind Overdraft Savings

**Example: ‚Çπ50L loan @ 8.6% for 20 years**

**Regular Loan:**
- Interest charged on: ‚Çπ50L √ó 30 days √ó 12 months √ó 20 years
- Total interest: ‚Çπ54.14L

**Overdraft (with ‚Çπ15L surplus):**
- Interest charged on: ‚Çπ35L effective (‚Çπ50L - ‚Çπ15L)
- Total interest: ‚Çπ38.50L
- **Savings: ‚Çπ15.64L!**

This is why overdraft at 8.85% can cost **less** than regular loan at 8.6%!
